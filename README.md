This code  is the first program I've written in Python and was completed within a day. It uses pandas and matplot to plot CO2 emissions data collected by Our World In Data (https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions). The first plot shows the top 10 countries with the highest emissions, not including land-use change emissions.
The second plot shows the per capita CO2 emissions of the top 5 CO2 emitters (and Canada for comparison) over a period of 2 decades.
